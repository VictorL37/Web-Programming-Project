# Web Programming Project — Ubuntu Travel

##  What Happened
While working on this project, we encountered an unexpected technical issue:  
One of our development computer screens stopped working during the final phase. This caused delays in final testing and uploading.

We discussed the situation with our Web Programming Coordinator and informed them that we'd upload the final project to GitHub as soon as possible.  
Thanks for your understanding — and sorry for any inconvenience caused.

## Inspiration Behind the Name
**Ubuntu** is a South African philosophy meaning *“I am because we are.”*  
It reflects our goal to design a site that connects people to people, culture, and nature through authentic travel experiences.
